# Introduction

I am a full-stack programmer from Colombia with 3 years of experience and I am on the platform since 2017 (starting from another account) which has brought 12.5M+ visits to the platform.

My motivations and focus are always in creating complex, optimized, functional and expandable systems.

I count on experience in sections such as:
- Implementing and working with VFX (I don't create them)
- I work very well with the user interface experience, and I know how to use libraries like **[Blend](https://quenty.github.io/NevermoreEngine/api/Blend/)** and [**Fusion**](https://elttob.uk/Fusion/)
- I am also good with data structures; I know how to work with libraries like [**Datastore2**](https://kampfkarren.github.io/Roblox/) and [**ProfileService**](https://madstudioroblox.github.io/ProfileService/), but I usually do my own implementations.
- I am familiar with [**Promises**](https://eryn.io/roblox-lua-promise/), and I use them a lot on my projects with things like DataStores, HTTP requests, etc.
- I know how to work with frameworks such as [**Knit**](https://sleitnick.github.io/Knit/) and [**Nevermore Engine**](https://quenty.github.io/NevermoreEngine/).
- I normally work with Rojo and Git.

In this repository, you can find samples of my code, in case you know about programming and are directly interested in seeing how my programming style and practices work.
## VFX demo and basic optimization showcase

[Here's](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ub3gRo5lYYAqcagEzAxRs0vXDW5vAFVp/view?usp=sharing) a place with basic VFX implementation:

**Why do I need to publish the game in order to test it?**
- The showcase contains a practical example of my basic way of working with DataStore.
## DataStore
[Here's](https://github.com/RenKa001/Code-showcase/blob/main/StandardDataStoreExample.lua) a code showcase of my basic way to work with DataStores using [Promises](https://eryn.io/roblox-lua-promise/)
## Pending list

- Add Knit and Nevermore Engine examples.
- More Promises examples.
- Blend and Fusion Examples.
