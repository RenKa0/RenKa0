# About me
I am a 18 years old full-stack programmer from Colombia with 3 years of experience and I am on the platform since 2016 (starting from another account) contributing 19M+ visits.

My motivations and focus are always in creating complex, optimized, functional and expandable systems (this means that i like creating well maded stuff).

## What can I do?
* I have a good knowledge of popular libraries, this also includes working with Frameworks such as Nevermore Engine and Knit and long code bases.
* I have a good knowledge with UI/UX, I work with UI libraries like [React-Lua](https://jsdotlua.github.io/react-lua/), [Fusion](https://elttob.uk/Fusion/0.2/) and [Blend](https://quenty.github.io/NevermoreEngine/api/Blend/). Most of my UI projects are powered with Fusion.
* I have a strong knowledge with DataStores, they are so cool.
* I know how to do other systems such as combat, weapons, movement, and others. This doesn't mean that I can't make mistakes in them or that I'm the best at them; I'm always willing to strengthen my knowledge.
