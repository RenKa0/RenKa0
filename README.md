# Introduction

I am a full-stack programmer with 2 years of experience and have been on the platform since 2017 (starting from another account).

My motivations and focus are always on creating complex, optimized, functional, and expandable systems

I count on experience in sections such as:
- Implementing and working with VFX (I don't create them)
- I work very well with the user interface experience, and I know how to use libraries like **[Blend](https://quenty.github.io/NevermoreEngine/api/Blend/)** and [**Fusion**](https://elttob.uk/Fusion/)
- I am also good with data structures; I know how to work with libraries like [**Datastore2**](https://kampfkarren.github.io/Roblox/) and [**ProfileService**](https://madstudioroblox.github.io/ProfileService/), but I usually do my own implementations.
- I am familiar with [**Promises**](https://eryn.io/roblox-lua-promise/) and i use them a lot on my projects with things like DataStores, Http request, etc...
- I know how to work with frameworks such as [**Knit**](https://sleitnick.github.io/Knit/) and [**Nevermore Engine**](https://quenty.github.io/NevermoreEngine/).
- I normally work with Rojo and Git.

in this repository you can find samples of my code, in case you know about programming and you are directly interested in seeing how is my programming style and my practices.
